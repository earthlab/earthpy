EarthPy makes it easier to plot and manipulate spatial data in Python.

## Why EarthPy?

Python is a generic programming language designed to support many different applications. Because of this, many commonly
performed spatial tasks for science including plotting and working with spatial data take many steps of code. EarthPy
builds upon the functionality developed for raster data (rasterio) and vector data (geopandas) in Python and simplifies the
code needed to:

* [Stack and crop raster bands from data such as Landsat into an easy to use numpy array](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/plot_raster_stack_crop.html)
* [Work with masks to set bad pixels such a those covered by clouds and cloud-shadows to NA (`mask_pixels()`)](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/plot_stack_masks.html#sphx-glr-gallery-vignettes-plot-stack-masks-py)
* [Plot rgb (color), color infrared and other 3 band combination images (`plot_rgb()`)](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/plot_rgb.html)
* [Plot bands of a raster quickly using `plot_bands()`](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/plot_bands_functionality.html)
* [Plot histograms for a set of raster files.](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/plot_hist_functionality.html)
* [Create discrete (categorical) legends](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/plot_draw_legend_docs.html)
* [Calculate vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (`normalized_diff()`)](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/plot_calculate_classify_ndvi.html)
* [Create hillshade from a DEM](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/plot_dem_hillshade.html)

EarthPy also has an `io` module that allows users to

1. Quickly access pre-created data subsets used in the earth-analytics courses hosted
on [www.earthdatascience.org](https://www.earthdatascience.org)
2. Download other datasets that they may want to use in their workflows.

EarthPy's design was inspired by the `raster` and `sp` package functionality available to `R` users.

applied examples of using EarthPy in common spatial workflows.

## Install

EarthPy can be installed using `pip`, but we **strongly** recommend that you install it using conda and the `conda-forge` channel.

### Install Using Conda / conda-forge Channel (Preferred)

If you are working within an Anaconda environment, we suggest that you install EarthPy using
`conda-forge`

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge earthpy
```

Note: if you want to set conda-forge as your default conda channel, you can use the following install workflow.
We recommmend this approach. Once you have run conda config, you can install earthpy without specifying a channel.

```bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install earthpy
```


### Install via Pip

We strongly suggest that you install EarthPy using conda-forge given pip can be more prone to 
spatial library dependency conflicts. However, you can install earthpy using pip.

To install EarthPy via `pip` use:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade earthpy
```

Once you have successfully installed EarthPy, you can import it into Python.

```python
>>> import earthpy.plot as ep
```

Below is a quick example of plotting multiple bands in a numpy array format.

```python
>>> arr = np.random.randint(4, size=(3, 5, 5))
>>> ep.plot_bands(arr, titles=["Band 1", "Band 2", "Band 3"])
>>> plt.show()
```

### Install on Fedora

To install EarthPy on Fedora, use:

```bash
$ dnf install python3-earthpy
```
